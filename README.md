# Assignment Overview

This assignment consists of four tasks covering front-end development, Java programming, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS**: Used for designing a responsive profile card with animations.
- **Java**: Used for string manipulation (anagram check) and object-oriented programming (Employee Management System).
- **JavaScript & DOM Manipulation**: Used for creating a dynamic to-do list.

## Task 1: Simple Profile Card

### Implementation Details
- Developed using **HTML and CSS**.
- Used **flexbox and media queries** to ensure responsiveness.
- Applied **CSS animations** for a hover effect.

### Features
- Displays a profile picture, name, designation, bio, and social media icons.
- Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Task 2: String Manipulation - Anagram Check

### Implementation Details
- Developed using **Java**.
- Used **character sorting** and **string comparison** to check for anagrams.

### Example
```
Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: true

Input: "hello", "world"
Output: false
```

## Task 3: Object-Oriented Programming - Employee Management System

### Implementation Details
- Created an `Employee` class with attributes: `id`, `name`, `salary`.
- Implemented a `displayDetails()` method to print employee details.
- Used **ArrayList** to store multiple Employee objects.

### Features
1. Created at least 3 Employee objects.
2. Stored them in a list.
3. Displayed their details using `displayDetails()`.

## Task 4: Simple To-Do List using JavaScript

### Implementation Details
- Developed using **JavaScript** and **DOM manipulation**.
- Used **event listeners** for task addition and removal.

### Features
- Users can add new tasks.
- Tasks are displayed in a list.
- Each task has a remove button.

## How to Run

1. **Profile Card**: Open question 1  `index.html` in a web browser.
2. **Anagram Check**: Compile and run `AnagramChecker.java` using a Java compiler.
3. **Employee Management**: Compile and run `EmployeeManagement.java` using a Java compiler.
4. **To-Do List**: Open question 4 `index.html` in a web browser.
